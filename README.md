<h1 align="center">Welcome, I'm Priyabrata Mishra</h1>

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a Data Scientist who builds end-to-end, production-ready solutions—from data collection and preprocessing to model development, deployment, and ongoing monitoring. My work spans statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning, with strong experience in Time Series Analysis, NLP, and Predictive Modeling.

Recently, my focus has expanded to Generative AI, including RAG systems, AI agents, and LLM-powered applications, along with designing and maintaining scalable ML and data pipelines in production environments. I enjoy working close to real-world systems, ensuring models are not just accurate, but reliable, observable, and impactful in practice.

I’ve applied these skills across multiple domains such as Marketing Tech, Sales Tech, Retail, Pharmacy, and Energy, and I’m driven by solving meaningful problems using practical, well-engineered AI solutions.
